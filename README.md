# Criteria

In this section, we will briefly discuss how our team addressed the applicable criteria:

## Overview

## Design

### Colour Scheme

Two seperate colour palettes have been used through this website. The first colour palette was used for the landing page and is a range of blues:

![blue colour image](assets/images/readme-images/blue-colours.png)

These colours fit well with the night theme of the landing page and set the spooky tone.

The second colour palette we chose was four colours more traditionally associated with Halloween, to fit in with the
Halloween theme of this hackathon:

### Fonts

[Metal Mania](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Metal+Mania?query=metal+mania)

[Playpen Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans)

We felt these fonts captured the gothic feel for our haunted mansion.

### Wireframes

TBC - the version used to be added

## Responsiveness

The website was designed to be responsive on a range of devices:

We considered only allowing the game to be played in landscape mode on smaller devices but, decided against this as we
thought it would impact the user experience and they may not want to play it if they had to take the extra step of
changing the view

## Planning

The project was planned through several huddles and messages through our Slack channel. A project board was created for team members to have an overview of the project, to be able to assign tasks to team members and to be able to easily see what tasks are yet to be started, are in progress, or have been completed.
